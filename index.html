        <h2>What is Smartphone Addiction?</h2>
        <p><span class="italictext">Smartphone addiction refers to a compulsive and uncontrolled urge to use smartphones, often at the expense of other important
		aspects of life. It is especially prevalent with the use of social media platforms, which are designed to capture attention through 
		constant notifications, endless scrolling, and engaging content.<span class="boldtext"> This persistent use can interfere with daily responsibilities,
		relationships, and overall well-being. Studies have shown that excessive smartphone use is linked to negative mental health outcomes, 
		including anxiety, depression, and feelings of social isolation</span>. These effects often stem from reduced face-to-face interactions, 
		disrupted sleep patterns, and the pressure to maintain an idealized online image. Over time, individuals may become dependent on their
		devices for entertainment, <span class="boldtext">validation, or coping with stress, further reinforcing the addictive behavior. 
		Addressing smartphone addiction requires conscious efforts such as setting time limits, practicing digital detox, and promoting balanced,
		mindful use of technology</span> to protect mental and emotional health.</span><br><br></p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p><span class="italictext">
            Reflecting on the development of this website, I have learned a great deal about the complexity of smartphone and social media addiction and how it can affect different aspects of people's lives. One of the biggest challenges I encountered was finding ways to present the problem in a way that resonates with the audience, making sure that it is both informative and engaging.
        </span>
		</p>
        <p><span class="italictext">
            The most significant aspect of this project was incorporating the **interactive elements**, such as the self-check survey and resources, which helped deepen the impact of the topic. I also had to balance the **visual presentation** to ensure the site remains easy to navigate and user-friendly. The real challenge came from making sure the content was not overwhelming while still providing detailed information about smartphone addiction and offering viable solutions.
        </span>
		</p>
        <p><span class="italictext">
            Overall, this website reflects the importance of **mindful technology use** and encourages users to assess their own habits and make improvements. In the future, I would love to further refine the **interactive tools** and provide even more **personalized recommendations** for people struggling with this addiction.
