    <h1>About This Project</h1>
    <hr>
   
      <p>
        This site explores <strong>addiction to smartphones and social media</strong>—how persuasive app design,
        notifications, and endless feeds can drive compulsive use and affect sleep, mood, attention, and real-world
        relationships. The goal is to translate research into practical, web-friendly guidance so visitors can recognize
        risk factors, reflect on their own habits, and take <em>small, sustainable steps</em> toward digital balance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Built for students and the wider campus community, the project combines concise bullet points with
        <strong>interactive tools</strong> (a usage self-check form), <strong>data visuals</strong> (time-on-device and
        wellbeing trends), and a curated <strong>TED Talk</strong> to add a human voice. All evidence is cited in APA
        style, and the <em>Resources &amp; Help</em> section points to credible mental-health supports, digital wellbeing
        guidelines, and app-based blockers or timers.
      </p>

        What you can do here: learn the signs of problematic use, try a brief digital-detox plan, set app limits, and
        create phone-free zones. If your use is causing distress or functional impairment, the site encourages reaching
        out for professional help. The mission is simple—<strong>use technology intentionally</strong> so it supports your
        goals, not the other way around.
